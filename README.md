## 1. Project Description
Our web application makes it easy to plan gatherings by finding the central meeting point between multiple addresses and suggesting nearby restaurants. Users can adjust the search radius, filter by restaurant rating, and choose options based on price point. Simply input your locations, and the app will display dining options around the middle point to help you organize meet-ups with friends effortlessly.
